# Contributing to the friends repo

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

This doc is about how to contribute to this repo specifically. For how to
contribute to tektoncd projects in general, see [the overview in our README](README.md)
and the individual `CONTRIBUTING.md` files in each respective project.

**All contributors must comply with
[the code of conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).**

PRs are welcome, and will follow
[the tektoncd pull request process](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/process.md#pull-request-process).

To add a new section for your company:
* create a new sub-directory under the `friends` directory, with an appropriate name.
* include a README.md file inside that with whatever information you're able to share.

Right now we do not enforce any strict schema or format on these README's, but we may in the future.
